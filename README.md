# Face Recognition Attendance System

A real-time face recognition attendance system built with Python and OpenCV that automatically detects and recognizes faces to mark attendance in a CSV file.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent attendance tracking system using computer vision technology. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects faces in real-time, compares them with pre-loaded training images, and automatically records attendance when a match is found.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier for robust face detection
- **Face Recognition**: Histogram-based feature extraction and comparison for accurate recognition
- **Automatic Attendance Tracking**: Records attendance with timestamp in CSV format
- **Live Video Processing**: Real-time webcam feed with visual feedback
- **Multi-person Support**: Can recognize multiple individuals simultaneously
- **User-friendly Interface**: Green boxes for recognized faces, red for unknown faces

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision and image processing
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Pillow** - Image handling

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
   ```

3. **Prepare training images**
   - Place clear, front-facing photos in the `Training images/` folder
   - Use person's name as filename (e.g., `John.JPG`, `Jane.PNG`)

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Training Phase
- System loads training images from the `Training images/` folder
- Extracts facial features using histogram-based analysis
- Creates a database of known faces for comparison

### 2. Recognition Phase
- Captures live video from webcam
- Detects faces in each frame using Haar Cascade
- Compares detected faces with training data
- Marks attendance when a match is found

### 3. Output
- Visual feedback: Green rectangles for recognized faces, red for unknown
- Attendance records saved to `Attendance.csv` with timestamp
- Real-time display of recognition results

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

1. **Start the application**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Position yourself**: Face the webcam clearly
3. **Wait for recognition**: Green box with name indicates successful recognition
4. **Check attendance**: View `Attendance.csv` for recorded entries
5. **Exit**: Press 'q' to quit the application

## 📊 Sample Output

The system generates attendance records in CSV format:
```
Name,Date,Time
JOHN,12/25/2024,14:30:15
JANE,12/25/2024,14:31:22
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Face Detection
- Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier
- Optimized for real-time performance
- Handles multiple faces simultaneously

### Feature Extraction
- Converts images to grayscale
- Resizes to standard dimensions (100x100)
- Calculates normalized histogram features

### Face Comparison
- Uses histogram correlation for similarity measurement
- Configurable threshold for recognition accuracy
- Returns best match with confidence score

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Educational Institutions**: Automated student attendance tracking
- **Corporate Offices**: Employee attendance management
- **Events & Conferences**: Participant registration
- **Security Systems**: Access control and monitoring

## 🔍 Performance Features

- **Real-time Processing**: 30+ FPS on standard hardware
- **High Accuracy**: Reliable face recognition with proper training images
- **Scalable**: Supports unlimited number of training images
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All face recognition happens locally
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: No data sent to external servers
- **Secure Storage**: Attendance data stored locally in CSV format

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Database integration for better data management
- [ ] Web interface for remote monitoring
- [ ] Advanced face recognition using deep learning
- [ ] Mobile app for remote attendance marking
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for attendance reports
